			This is a brief extract from an article that explores the first and most fundamental technology used in 
			Web-based applications: HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is a standard for describing the structure 
			and presentation of information via the Internet. Web developers use HTML keywords or tags to instruct the 
			Web browser application how to format and display the content of Web pages.

		<h1>The Roots of HTML</h1>
		<p2>
			Only a few years ago, the typical "Web application" consisted entirely of a set of static Web pages written in HTML. 
			In contrast, today's Web-based applications utilises many new technologies to provide a dynamic and interactive 
			applications across the Internet. Nonetheless, HTML code is still found at the core of the vast majority of Web

		<h1>Being a markup language</h1>
		<p3>
			As a markup language, the purpose of HTML is to provide a set of general rules that suggest how content 
			should look when rendered. A markup language doesn't dictate the methods used to display the content, nor does it 
			have foreknowledge of the target context, so this control is imprecise. An important addition to HTML was the 
			inclusion of support for hypertext, which enabled authors to define a semantic network of linked information.
