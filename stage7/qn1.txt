Question 2: Horray! Now that you know basic HTML syntax, the gate keeper teaches you on basic CSS.
Change the text inside the <body> to monospace font. Let the font be Inconsolata which can be found in Google fonts.
Change the fonts size of the header 1 to 24 px.
Change the font colour of the paragraphs to red.
|Note: Please follow the sequence given as the code runs on strict checking and delete the style comments.
|<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>This defines the title in the browser toolbar</title>
		<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inconsolata&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
		<style>
		/*This is a comment in style/CSS.
		This is where CSS syntax can be written.*/
		</style>
	</head>
	
	<body>
		<h1>This is heading 1, signifying the most important heading.</h1>
		<h2>There are 6 HTML headers. The tag 'h6'defines the least important heading.</h2>
		<p>This signifies a paragraph. It normally goes after a header. 
		For this case, it goes after header 2.</p>
	</body>
</html>
