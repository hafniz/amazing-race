Question 3: Excellent! The gate keeper now flips to a page that requires your help.
He wants you to help him format his favourite code (under life motto, inside <pre> tag) by placing the whole code under a <blockquote> tag.
Make it fancier by changing blockquote's background color to swan white, using its HEX format #f7f1e3.
|Note: Using 'Tab' to create an indentation is not available. Please refrain from creating and using id's & class.

		<h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p1>This is a brief extract from an article that explores the first and most fundamental technology used in 
        Web-based applications: HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is a standard for describing the structure 
        and presentation of information via the Internet. Web developers use HTML keywords or tags to instruct the 
        Web browser application how to format and display the content of Web pages.</p1>
    <pre>   //life motto
    if (sad() === true){
      sad().stop();
      beAwesome();
    }</pre>

    <h1>The Roots of HTML</h1>
    <p2>Only a few years ago, the typical "Web application" consisted entirely of a set of static Web pages written in HTML. 
        In contrast, today's Web-based applications utilises many new technologies to provide a dynamic and interactive 
        applications across the Internet. Nonetheless, HTML code is still found at the core of the vast majority of Web 
        applications. </p2>

    <h1>Being a markup language</h1>
    <p3> As a markup language, the purpose of HTML is to provide a set of general rules that suggest how content 
         should look when rendered. A markup language doesn't dictate the methods used to display the content, nor does it 
         have foreknowledge of the target context, so this control is imprecise. An important addition to HTML was the 
         inclusion of support for hypertext, which enabled authors to define a semantic network of linked information.</p3>
