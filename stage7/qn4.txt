		<h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p1>This is a brief extract from an article that explores the first and most 
    fundamental technology used in Web-based applications: HTML, the Hypertext Markup 
    Language. HTML is a standard for describing the structure and presentation of 
    information via the Internet. Web developers use HTML keywords or tags to instruct the 
    Web browser application how to format and display the content of Web pages.</p1>
    <blockquote>
    <pre>   //life motto
    if (sad() === true){
      sad().stop();
      beAwesome();
    }</pre> </blockquote>
    <br>
		<h1>The Roots of HTML</h1>
		<p2>Only a few years ago, the typical "Web application" consisted entirely of a set of 
    static Web pages written in HTML. In contrast, today's Web-based applications utilises 
    many new technologies to provide a dynamic and interactive applications across the 
    Internet. Nonetheless, HTML code is still found at the core of the vast majority of Web 
    applications. </p2>
    <br>
    <h1>Being a markup language</h1>
    <p3> As a markup language, the purpose of HTML is to provide a set of general rules 
    that suggest how content should look when rendered. A markup language doesn't dictate 
    the methods used to display the content, nor does it have foreknowledge of the target 
    context, so this control is imprecise. An important addition to HTML was the inclusion 
    of support for hypertext, which enabled authors to define a semantic network of linked 
    information.</p3>
